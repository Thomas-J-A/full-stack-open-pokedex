Pytest can be used to unit test Python code in a CI pipeline. The codecov library can help identify untested and potentially buggy code. flake8 is a popular tool for linting.

There are many CI tools for both the cloud on on-premise. They can differ in their support for both third-party plugins and version control systems. Jenkins is the most popular tool for on-premise. AWS has a service named CodePipeline which integrates with their other Code\* services to provide a complete cloud-based CI/CD chain. Azure offers their own version named Azure Pipelines. CircleCI may be used both on-prem and in the cloud. GitLab is a modern alternative which aims to be a complete DevOps solution.

On a project with six developers, a cloud-based CI solution might be preferable since maintenance is handled by the provider, ensuring the limited number of developers can concentrate on essential tasks and not on various configurations. It would also be cheaper than paying for the hardware required for an on-premise CI server, so is better for smaller teams with smaller budgets. However, if the project is sufficiently large enough, it may reach the resource limits of a cloud-based solution during the CI process, in which case on-premise may be more suitable.
